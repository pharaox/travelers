* Reduced by half the probability of death for all new events, unless it's a certain death.

## Version 0.5.0

### Performance

* Improved location tracking accuracy outside of scheduled location tracker runs.

  * As a result, location tracker events can now be disabled with very small impact on accuracy.

### Housekeeping

* Added debug code and logs to measure location tracking inaccuracy chance.

### Core Travel

* Enhanced travel mechanics for imprisoned characters.
  * Imprisoned characters always travel as companions of a "prisoner escort" group leader.
  * If the escorting character travel is aborted for any reason, e.g. death due to an event, all prisoners escape.
  * Imprisoned rulers can't have entourages, although they are still assigned a "prison guard" travel leader.

### Travel Events

* Added 14 new travel danger events for non-ruler group leaders, loosely based on existing vanilla events.
  * Other group members may also participate in the resolution of such an event, and all may suffer its consequences.
  * The player is informed about such events with appropriate messages.
  * These events can also happen to prisoner escort characters and so can affect traveling prisoners.

### Game Rules
